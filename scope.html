                In a security CTF competition, we give you permission to attack various simulated resources in various
                ways. It is important to outline our expectations of you and your expectations of us, so that you can
                compete fairly. This scope document defines what you are allowed to attack and how as part of the competition.

                By taking part in the event, you agree to only act within the following scope.
                If you purposely act outside of this scope, you and your team may be disqualified from the event and
                could even face disciplinary or legal action from NUSU/the university in the most severe cases.
